abstract = {In this paper we demonstrate a framework for the efficient development of textual domain specific languages and supporting tools. We use a redundance-free and compact definition of a readable concrete syntax and a comprehensible abstract syntax as both representations significantly overlap in their structure. To further improve the usability of the abstract syntax, this definition format integrates additional concepts like associations and inheritance into the well-understood grammar-based approach. Modularity concepts like language inheritance and embedding are used to simplify the development of languages based on already existing ones. In addition, the generation of editors and a template approach for code generation is explained.},

  abstract = "Hospital information systems (HIS) have to be considered as
              socio-technical systems, which consist of technical components as
              well as of the human aspect like hospital staff and patients. HIS
              strive for the optimization of information logistics, to support
              tasks like patient care and administration of a hospital. To
              systematically manage such complex systems, HIS can be analyzed
              on three layers: First, tasks and entity types should be
              considered. Entity types represent information which is used and
              updated by tasks like 'Patient Admission' or 'Decision Making'.
              Second, application components of a HIS should be analyzed, they
              can be either computer-based or paper-based; both of them support
              tasks from the first layer. Therefore, they store and exchange
              information. The third layer analyzes physical data processing
              components of a HIS, like servers, workstations or networks. The
              three-layered view can be used for the systematic information
              management of HIS on three perspectives: strategic information
              management plans the development of the whole HIS for the next 5
              years and longer. Measures from strategic information management
              are implemented as projects, coordinated by the tactical
              information management. The operational information management
              ensures a continuous and reliable operation of the HIS.",

              three-layer graph-based meta model {3LGM2}",
  author   = "Winter, A and Brigl, B and Wendt, T",
  abstract = "OBJECTIVES: Not only architects but also information managers
              need models and modeling tools for their subject of work.
              Especially for supporting strategic information management in
              hospitals, the meta model 3LGM2 is presented as an ontological
              basis for modeling the comprehensive information system of a
              hospital (HIS). METHODS: In a case study, requirements for
              modeling HIS have been deduced. Accordingly 3LGM2 has been
              designed to describe HIS by concepts on three layers. The domain
              layer consists of enterprise functions and entity types, the
              logical tool layer focuses on application components and the
              physical tool layer describes physical data processing
              components. In contrast to other approaches a lot of
              inter-layer-relationships exist. 3LGM2 is defined using the
              Unified Modeling Language (UML). RESULTS: Models of HIS can be
              created which comprise not only technical and semantic aspects
              but also computer-based and paper-based information processing. A
              software tool supporting the creation of 3LGM2 compliant models
              in a graphical way has been developed. The tool supports in
              detecting those shortcomings at the logical or the physical tool
              layers which make it impossible to satisfy the information needs
              at the domain layer. 3LGM2 can also be used as an ontology for
              describing HIS in natural language. CONCLUSIONS: Strategic
              information management even in large hospitals should be and can
              be supported by dedicated methods and tools. Although there have
              been good experiences with 3LGM2 concerning digital document
              archiving at the Leipzig University Hospital, which are presented
              in part 2, the benefit of the proposed method and tool has to be
              further evaluated.",

Its development was considered to be an important step in reducing the fragmentation that was witnessed between the existing process modeling tools and notations. Since then BPMN has been evaluated in different ways by the academic community and has become widely supported and used by industry. After completing the first major revisions of BPMN, the Object Management Group (OMG) released BPMN 2.0 in 2011. This chapter gives an overview of BPMN 2.0 and summarizes some of the evaluations of BPMN used for analysis and design of business processes and presents these together with reported experiences as well as some examples of proposed extensions and future expectations based on these. We will based on this also present some implications for practitioners.",
